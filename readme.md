## About
I created this GitHub account to track my progress on what I've been learning and working on.

I'm heavily interested in low-level computer concepts and systems administration.\
I am _self taught_ and eager to learn more concepts to help me get into the field.\
You can find what I'm working on and learning by viewing the [next section](#Current-Study-Path).

## Current Study Path
I'm currently studying fundamental concepts in *_nix_ system environments.\
I've always been interested in the Unix kernel, starting with [Fedora Linux](https://www.fedoraproject.org/) and later moving to [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org).\
I have more experience with the latter, setting it up on multiple systems and a simple home server, but I definitely need to home-in my skills with both!
</br>
### To-Do
- [ ] Create a simple program that can communicate over a network
