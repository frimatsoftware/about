## About
I created this GitHub account to track my progress on what I've been learning and working on.

I'm heavily interested in low-level computer concepts and systems administration. I am _self taught_ and eager to learn more concepts to help me get into the field. You can find what I'm working on and learning by viewing the [file structure](#File-Structure) section.

## File Structure
You can find all my projects at the root of my [GitHub page](https://github.com/frimatsoftware).

If you would like to see what I'm currently learning and working on (concepts, languages, projects, etc.)
you can view [current.md](/current.md)
